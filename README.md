# 🎯INSIGHTIFY - Social Media Content Analyzer

**INSIGHTIFY** is a powerful web application built with **React + Vite** that helps users analyze and optimize social media content before sharing. Its goal is to simplify content evaluation while providing meaningful insights to improve audience engagement.

The app allows content to be uploaded easily through a **drag-and-drop interface** or standard file selection, making it user-friendly and flexible.  

It supports multiple file formats:  
- **Images** – Text is extracted using **Tesseract.js (OCR)**.  
- **PDF files** – Text is automatically parsed using **PDF.js** or custom parsing utilities.  

Once the text is extracted, the app performs **sentiment analysis** to determine tone (positive, negative, or neutral) and generates **custom recommendations** to improve clarity, engagement, and overall social media impact.  

By combining OCR, PDF parsing, sentiment insights, and actionable suggestions, INSIGHTIFY equips content creators with the tools they need to craft compelling posts that resonate with their audience.
